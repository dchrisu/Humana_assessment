Hello all those viewing. This is my solution to the Coding Assessment provided.

Coding Assessment
Using VS Code, write a C# solution to take in an input of a paragraph and:
1) Give the number of palindrome words: CalculateNumberOfPalindromeWords()
2) Give the number of palindrome sentences: CalculateNumberOfPalindromeSentences()
3) List the unique words of a paragraph with the count of the word instance: GetListAndCountOfUniqueWords()
4) Let the user also input a letter at some point and list all words containing that letter: GetAllWordsFromParagraphContainingInputLetter()

Write up a short documentation explaining what your program does.

Upload the program to GitHub or alternative Git repository hosting service. Once you have done so, send that link to me to forward to the managers for review.
